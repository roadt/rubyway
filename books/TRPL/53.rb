# 5.3. Iterators and Enumerable Objects

# Although while, until, and for loops are a core part of the Ruby language, it is probably more common to write loops using special methods known as iterators. Iterators are one of the most noteworthy features of Ruby, and examples such as the following are common in introductory Ruby tutorials: 

3.times { puts 'thank you!'}
data = [1,2,3,4]
data.each{|x| puts x}
[1,2,3].map{|x| x*x}
factorial = 1
n = 10
2.upto(n) {|x| factorial*=x}
puts factorial


# The times, each, map, and upto methods are all iterators, and they interact with the block of code that follows them. The complex control structure behind this is yield. The yield statement temporarily returns control from the iterator method to the method that invoked the iterator. Specifically, control flow goes from the iterator to the block of code associated with the invocation of the iterator. When the end of the block is reached, the iterator method regains control and execution resumes at the first statement following the yield. In order to implement some kind of looping construct, an iterator method will typically invoke the yield statement multiple times. Figure 5-1 illustrates this complex flow of control. Blocks and yield are described in detail in Section 5.4 below; for now, we focus on the iteration itself rather than the control structure that enables it. 

# Figure 5-1. An iterator yielding to its invoking method  [Picture can't show]

# As you can see from the previous examples, blocks may be parameterized. Vertical bars at the start of a block are like parentheses in a method definitionâ€”they hold a list of parameter names. The yield statement is like a method invocation; it is followed by zero or more expressions whose values are assigned to the block parameters.

  Iterators that Don't Iterate

We use the term iterator in this book to mean any method that uses the yield statement. They do not actually have to serve an iteration or looping function.[*] The tap method defined (in Ruby 1.9) by the Object class is an example. It invokes the associated block once, passing the receiver as the only argument. Then it returns the receiver. It is handy for "tapping into" a method chain, as in the following code which uses tap to output debugging messages: 
=end

chars = "hello world".tap {|x| puts "original object: #{x.inspect}"}
  .each_char .tap {|x| puts "each_char returns: #{x.inspect}"}
  .to_a              .tap {|x| puts "to_a returns: #{x.inspect}"}
  .map {|c| c.succ } .tap {|x| puts "map returns: #{x.inspect}" }
  .sort              .tap {|x| puts "sort returns: #{x.inspect}"}

#Another common function for iterators is automatic resource deallocation. The File.open method can be used as an iterator, for example. It opens the named file, creating a File object to represent it. If no block is associated with the invocation, it simply returns the File object and leaves the responsibility for closing the file with the calling code. If there is a block associated with the File.open call, however, it passes the new File object to that block and then automatically closes the file when the block returns. This ensures that files will always be closed and frees programmers from this housekeeping detail. In this case, when a block is associated with the call to File.open, the return value of method is not a File object but whatever value the block returned. 

# [*] Within the Japanese Ruby community, the term "iterator" has fallen out of use because it implies an iteration that is not actually required. A phrase like "method that expects an associated block" is verbose but more precise.

# 5.3.1. Numeric Iterators

# The core Ruby API provides a number of standard iterators. The Kernel method loop behaves like an infinite loop, running its associated block repeatedly until the block executes a return, break, or other statement that exits from the loop. 

loop do
  i = 10
  while i > 0 do  
    print  i; i-=1; 
    break if i == 5
  end
  break
end
puts

#  The Integer class defines three commonly used iterators. 
#    The upto method invokes its associated block once for each integer between the integer on which it is invoked and the integer which is passed as an argument. For example: 

4.upto(6) {|x| print x} #=> 456
puts
# As you can see, upto yields each integer to the associated block, and it includes both the starting point and the end point in the iteration. In general, n.upto(m) runs its block m-n+1 times. 
  

# The downto method is just like upto but iterates from a larger number down to a smaller number. 
6.downto(4){|x| print x} #654
puts

#When the Integer.times method is invoked on the integer n, it invokes its block n times, passing values 0 through n-1 on successive iterations. For example: 

3.times{|x| print x}
puts
# In general, n.times is equivalent to 0.upto(n-1). 

# If you want to do a numeric iteration using floating-point numbers, you can use the more complex step method defined by the Numeric class. The following iterator, for example, starts at 0 and iterates in steps of 0.1 until it reaches Math::PI: 

0.step(Math::PI/2, Math::PI/6){|x| puts Math.sin(x) }



# 5.3.2. Enumerable Objects

# Array, Hash, Range, and a number of other classes define an each iterator that passes each element of the collection to the associated block. This is perhaps the most commonly used iterator in Ruby; as we saw earlier, the for loop only works for iterating over objects that have each methods. Examples of each iterators: 

[1,2,3].each{|x| print x} # => prints "123"
(1..3).each {|x| print x} # => prints "123" same as 1.upto(3)

# The each iterator is not only for traditional "data structure" classes. Ruby's IO class defines an each iterator that yields lines of text read from the Input/Output object. Thus, you can process the lines of a file in Ruby with code like this: 

File.open(__FILE__) do |f|
  f.each_with_index do|line,number|
    print "#{number}: #{line}"
  end
end


# Some of the most commonly used Enumerable iterators are the rhyming methods collect, select, reject, and inject. The collect method (also known as map) executes its associated block for each element of the enumerable object, and collects the return values of the blocks into an array: 

print squares = [1,2,3].collect{|x| x*x} #=> [1,4,9]

# The select method invokes the associated block for each element in the enumerable object, and returns an array of elements for which the block returns a value other than false or nil. For example: 

print evens = (1..10).select{|x| x%2 == 0} #=>[2,4,6,8,10]

# the reject method is simply the opposite of select; it returns an array of elements for which the block returns nil or false. For example: 

odds = (1..10).reject{|x| x%2 == 0} #=> [1,3,5,7,9]

# The inject method is a little more complicated than the others. It invokes the associated block with two arguments. The first argument is an accumulated value of some sort from previous iterations. The second argument is the next element of the enumerable object. The return value of the block becomes the first block argument for the next iteration, or becomes the return value of the iterator after the last iteration. The initial value of the accumulator variable is either the argument to inject, if there is one, or the first element of the enumerable object. (In this case, the block is invoked just once for the first two elements.) Examples make inject more clear: 

 
data = [2, 5, 3, 4]
sum = data.inject {|sum, x| sum + x }      # => 14    (2+5+3+4)
floatprod = data.inject(1.0) {|p,x| p*x }  # => 120.0 (1.0*2*5*3*4)
max = data.inject {|m,x| m>x ? m : x }     # => 5     (largest element)
puts
# See Section 9.5.1 for further details on the Enumerable module and its iterators. 


# 5.3.3. Writing Custom Iterators

# The defining feature of an iterator method is that it invokes a block of code associated with the method invocation. You do this with the yield statement. The following method is a trivial iterator that just invokes its block twice: 

def twice
  yield
  yield
end

twice {print 'twice this!'}
puts

# To pass argument values to the block, follow the yield statement with a comma-separated list of expressions. As with method invocation, the argument values may optionally be enclosed in parentheses. The following simple iterator shows a use of yield: 

# This method expects a block. It generates n values of the form
# m*i + c, for i from 0..n-1, and yields them, one at a time, 
# to the associated block.
def sequence(n, m, c)
  i = 0
  while(i < n)      # Loop n times
    yield m*i + c   # Invoke the block, and pass a value to it
    i += 1          # Increment i each time
  end
end

# Here is an invocation of that method, with a block.
# It prints the values 1, 6, and 11
sequence(3, 5, 1) {|y| print y }
puts

=begin
Nomenclature: yield and Iterators

Depending on your programming background, you may find the terms "yield" and "iterator" confusing. The sequence method shown earlier is a fairly clear example of why yield has the name it does. After computing each number in the sequence, the method yields control (and yields the computed number) to the block, so that the block can work with it. It is not always this clear, however; in some code it may seem as if it is the block that is yielding a result back to the method that invoked it. 

A method such as sequence that expects a block and invokes it multiple times is called an iterator because it looks and behaves like a loop. This may be confusing if you are used to languages like Java in which iterators are objects. In Java, the client code that uses the iterator is in control and "pulls" values from the iterator when it needs them. In Ruby, the iterator method is in control and "pushes" values to the block that wants them. 

This nomenclature issue is related to the distinction between "internal iterators" and "external iterators," which is discussed later in this section. 
=end

# Here is another example of a Ruby iterator; it passes two arguments to its block. It is worth noticing that the implementation of this iterator uses another iterator internally: 

# Generate n points evenly spaced around the circumference of a 
# circle of radius r centered at (0,0). Yield the x and y coordinates
# of each point to the associated block.
def circle(r,n)
  n.times do |i|    # Notice that this method is implemented with a block
    angle = Math::PI * 2 * i / n
    yield r*Math.cos(angle), r*Math.sin(angle)
  end
end
# This invocation of the iterator prints:
# (1.00, 0.00) (0.00, 1.00) (-1.00, 0.00) (-0.00, -1.00)
circle(1,4) {|x,y| printf "(%.2f, %.2f) ", x, y }
puts

# Using the yield keyword really is a lot like invoking a method. (See Chapter 6 for complete details on method invocation.) Parentheses around the arguments are optional. You can use * to expand an array into individual arguments. yield even allows you to pass a hash literal without the curly braces around it. Unlike a method invocation, however, a yield expression may not be followed by a block. You cannot pass a block to a block. 

# If a method is invoked without a block, it is an error for that method to yield, because there is nothing to yield to. Sometimes you want to write a method that yields to a block if one is provided but takes some default action (other than raising an error) if invoked with no block. To do this, use block_given? to determine whether there is a block associated with the invocation. block_given?, and its synonym iterator?, are Kernel methods, so they act like global functions. Here is an example: 

# Return an array with n elements of the form m*i+c
# If a block is given, also yield each element to the block
def sequence(n, m, c)
  i, s = 0, []                  # Initialize variables
  while(i < n)                  # Loop n times
    y = m*i + c                 # Compute value
    yield y if block_given?     # Yield, if block
    s << y                      # Store the value
    i += 1
  end
  s                             # Return the array of values
end

print sequence(3,5,1)
print sequence(3, 5, 1) {|y| print y }
puts


# 5.3.4. Enumerators

# An enumerator is an Enumerable object whose purpose is to enumerate some other object. To use enumerators in Ruby 1.8, you must require 'enumerator'. In Ruby 1.9, enumerators are built-in and no require is necessary. (As we'll see later, the built-in enumerators of Ruby 1.9 have substantially more functionality than that provided by the enumerator library of Ruby 1.8.) 

# Enumerators are of class Enumerable::Enumerator. Although this class can be instantiated directly with new, this is not how enumerators are typically created. Instead, use to_enum or its synonym enum_for, which are methods of Object. With no arguments, to_enum returns an enumerator whose each method simply calls the each method of the target object. Suppose you have an array and a method that expects an enumerable object. You don't want to pass the array object itself, because it is mutable, and you don't trust the method not to modify it. Instead of making a defensive deep copy of the array, just call to_enum on it, and pass the resulting enumerator instead of the array itself. In effect, you're creating an enumerable but immutable proxy object for your array: 

# Call this method with an Enumerator instead of a mutable array.
# This is a useful defensive strategy to avoid bugs.
def process s
  for c in s
    print c,'-'
  end
end
process(data.to_enum)  # Instead of just process(data)
puts

# You can also pass arguments to to_enum, although the enum_for synonym seems more natural in this case. The first argument should be a symbol that identifies an iterator method. The each method of the resulting Enumerator will invoke the named method of the original object. Any remaining arguments to enum_for will be passed to that named method. In Ruby 1.9, the String class is not Enumerable, but it defines three iterator methods: each_char, each_byte, and each_line. Suppose we want to use an Enumerable method, such as map, and we want it to be based on the each_char iterator. We do this by creating an enumerator: 

s = "hello"
print s.enum_for(:each_char).map {|c| c.succ }  # => ["i", "f", "m", "m", "p"]

# In Ruby 1.9, it is usually not even necessary to use to_enum or enum_for explicitly as we did in the previous examples. This is because the built-in iterator methods of Ruby 1.9 (which include the numeric iterators times, upto, downto, and step, as well as each and related methods of Enumerable) automatically return an enumerator when invoked with no block. So, to pass an array enumerator to a method rather than the array itself, you can simply call the each method: 

process(s.each_char) # instead of just proces


# This syntax is even more natural if we use the chars alias[*] in place of each_char. To map the characters of a string to an array of characters, for example, just use .chars.map:

# [*] chars was omitted from Ruby 1.9.0, but this oversight was corrected shortly after the initial release.

print "hello".chars.map{|c| c.succ}

# Here are some other examples that rely on enumerator objects returned by iterator methods. Note that it is not just iterator methods defined by Enumerable that can return enumerator objects; numeric iterators like times and upto do the same: 

enumerator = 3.times             # An enumerator object
enumerator.each {|x| print x }   # Prints "012"

# downto returns an enumerator with a select method
print 10.downto(1).select {|x| x%2==0}  # => [10,8,6,4,2]
# each_byte iterator returns an enumerator with a to_a method
print "hello".each_byte.to_a            # => [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
puts

# You can duplicate this behavior in your own iterator methods by returning self.to_enum when no block is supplied. Here, for example, is a version of the twice iterator shown earlier that can return an enumerator if no block is provided: 

def twice(*rest)
  if block_given?
    yield rest
    yield rest
  else
    self.to_enum(:twice, *rest)
  end
end

print twice(1,2) {|x| print x}
print twice(1,2).to_a
puts

# In Ruby 1.9, enumerator objects define a with_index method that is not available in the Ruby 1.8 enumerator module. with_index simply returns a new enumerator that adds an index parameter to the iteration. For example, the following returns an enumerator that yields the characters of a string and their index within the string: 

enumerator = s.each_char.with_index
enumerator.each{|x,y| print x,y }

# Finally, keep in mind that enumerators, in both Ruby 1.8 and 1.9, are Enumerable objects that can be used with the for loop. For example: 

for line, number in s.each_line.with_index
  print "#{number+1}: #{line}"
end
puts


# 5.3.5. External Iterators

# Our discussion of enumerators has focused on their use as Enumerable proxy objects. In Ruby 1.9, however, enumerators have another very important use: they are external iterators. You can use an enumerator to loop through the elements of a collection by repeatedly calling the next method. When there are no more elements, this method raises a StopIteration exception: 

iterator = 9.downto(1)             # An enumerator as external iterator
begin                              # So we can use rescue below
  print iterator.next while true   # Call the next method repeatedly
rescue StopIteration               # When there are no more values
  puts "...blastoff!"              # An expected, nonexceptional condition
end
puts


=begin

Internal versus External Iterators

The "gang of four" define and contrast internal and external iterators quite clearly in their design patterns book:[*] 

A fundamental issue is deciding which party controls the iteration, the iterator or the client that uses the iterator. When the client controls the iteration, the iterator is called an external iterator, and when the iterator controls it, the iterator is an internal iterator. Clients that use an external iterator must advance the traversal and request the next element explicitly from the iterator. In contrast, the client hands an internal iterator an operation to perform, and the iterator applies that operation to every element.... 

External iterators are more flexible than internal iterators. It's easy to compare two collections for equality with an external iterator, for example, but it's practically impossible with internal iteratorsâ€¦. But on the other hand, internal iterators are easier to use, because they define the iteration logic for you. 

In Ruby, iterator methods like each are internal iterators; they control the iteration and "push" values to the block of code associated with the method invocation. Enumerators have an each method for internal iteration, but in Ruby 1.9 and later, they also work as external iteratorsâ€”client code can sequentially "pull" values from an enumerator with next. 

=end


# Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides (Addison-Wesley).

# External iterators are quite simple to use: just call next each time you want another element. When there are no more elements left, next will raise a StopIteration exception. This may seem unusualâ€”an exception is raised for an expected termination condition rather than an unexpected and exceptional event. (StopIteration is a descendant of StandardError and IndexError; note that it is one of the only exception classes that does not have the word "error" in its name.) Ruby follows Python in this external iteration technique. By treating loop termination as an exception, it makes your looping logic extremely simple; there is no need to check the return value of next for a special end-of-iteration value, and there is no need to call some kind of next? predicate before calling next. 

# To simplify looping with external iterators, the Kernel.loop method includes (in Ruby 1.9) an implicit rescue clause and exits cleanly when StopIteration is raised. Thus, the countdown code shown earlier could more easily be written like this:

iterator = 9.downto(1)
loop do                      # loop until StopIteration is raised.
  print iterator.next  # print next item
end
puts "...blastoff!"


# Many external iterators can be restarted by calling the rewind method. Note, however, that rewind is not effective for all enumerators. If an enumerator is based on an object like a File which reads lines sequentially, calling rewind will not restart the iteration from the beginning. In general, if new invocations of each on the underlying Enumerable object do not restart the iteration from the beginning, then calling rewind will not restart it either. 

# Once an external iteration has started (i.e., after next has been called for the first time), an enumerator cannot be cloned or duplicated. It is typically possible to clone an enumerator before next is called, or after StopIteration has been raised or rewind is called. 

# Normally, enumerators with next methods are created from Enumerable objects that have an each method. If, for some reason, you define a class that provides a next method for external iteration instead of an each method for internal iteration, you can easily implement each in terms of next. In fact, turning an externally iterable class that implements next into an Enumerable class is as simple as mixing in (with includeâ€”see Section 7.5) a module like this: 

module Iterable
  include Enumerable
  def each
    loop { yield self.next }
  end
end

# Another way to use an external iterator is to pass it to an internal iterator method like this one: 

def iterate(iterator)
  loop { yield iterator.next }
end
iterate(9.downto(1)) {|x| print x}
puts


# The earlier quote from Design Patterns alluded to one of the key features of external iterators: they solve the parallel iteration problem. Suppose you have two Enumerable collections and need to iterate their elements in pairs: the first elements of each collection, then the second elements, and so on. Without an external iterator, you must convert one of the collections to an array (with the to_a method defined by Enumerable) so that you can access its elements while iterating the other collection with each. 

# Example 5-1 shows the implementation of three iterator methods. All three accept an arbitrary number of Enumerable objects and iterate them in different ways. One is a simple sequential iteration using only internal iterators; the other two are parallel iterations and can only be done using the external iteration features of enumerators. 


# Example 5-1. Parallel iteration with external iterators

# Call the each method of each collection in turn.
# This is not a parallel iteration and does not require enumerators
def sequence(*enumerables, &block)
  enumerables.each do |enumerable|
    enumerable.each(&block)
  end
end


# Iterate the specified collections, interleaving their elements.
# This can't be done efficiently without external iterators.
# Note the use of the uncommon else clause in begin/rescue.

def interleave(*enumerables)
  # Convert enumerable collections to an array of enumerators
  enumerators = enumerables.map {|x| x.to_enum}
  until enumerators.empty?
    begin
      e = enumerators.shift    # 1st enumerator
      yield e.next                   # yield next to block
    rescue StopIteration   # exception, end, e pop out
    else
      enumerators << e    # no exception, not end, put e back. until end.
    end
  end
end

# Iterate the specified collections, yielding tuples of values,
# one value from each of the collections. See also Enumerable.zip.
def bundle(*enumerables)
  enumerators = enumerables.map {|x| x.to_enum}
  loop do yield enumerators.map{|e| e.next} end
end


# # Examples of how these iterator methods work
a,b,c=[1,2,3], 4..6, 'a'..'e'
sequence(a,b,c) {|x| print x}; puts
interleave(a,b,c) {|x| print x};puts
bundle(a,b,c) {|x| print x}  ; puts


# The bundle method of Example 5-1 is similar to the Enumerable.zip method. In Ruby 1.8, zip must first convert its Enumerable arguments to arrays and then use those arrays while iterating through the Enumerable object it is called on. In Ruby 1.9, however, the zip method can use external iterators. This makes it (typically) more efficient in space and time, and also allows it to work with unbounded collections that could not be converted into an array of finite size. 

print "abcdef".each_char.zip(1..6)
def myzip(*enumerables)
  enumerators = enumerables.map {|x| x.to_enum}
  res = []
  loop do res << enumerators.map{|e| e.next} end
  res
end
print myzip('abcdef'.each_char,1..6)
pputs

# 5.3.6. Iteration and Concurrent Modification
 
# In general, Ruby's core collection of classes iterate over live objects rather than private copies or "snapshots" of those objects, and they make no attempt to detect or prevent concurrent modification to the collection while it is being iterated. If you call the each method of an array, for example, and the block associated with that invocation calls the shift method of the same array, the results of the iteration may be surprising: 

a = [1,2,3,4,5]
a.each{|x| print "#{x},#{a.shift}  "}
puts
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
a.each.each{|x| print "#{x},#{a.shift}  "}
puts

# You may see similarly surprising behavior if one thread modifies a collection while another thread is iterating it. One way to avoid this is to make a defensive copy of the collection before iterating it. The following code, for example, adds a method each_in_snapshot to the Enumerable module: 

module Enumerable
  def each_in_snapshot &block
    snapshot = self.dup    # Make a private copy of the Enumerable object
    snapshot.each &block   # And iterate on the copy
  end
end

a = [1,2,3,4,5]
a.each_in_snapshot{|x| print "#{x},#{a.shift}  "}
print a
